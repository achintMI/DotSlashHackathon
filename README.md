<b>A Simple Android App to render movie trailer on its poster in Augmented Reality, so that user don't have to go and search for trailers to watch them. Just scan the poster and enjoy the trailer.</b><br>
<hr>
## Technical Approach
open the app to scan the poster of any movie, after scanning the system will process the image to extract the name of the movie and make a request for fetching the trailer URL which is stored on the server. <br>
## Tech Stack
<hr>
Unity, Vuforia, C#, Android<br>
<hr>
## How to Run
Open Testing Folder and then install the VideoPlayer.apk in an android device<br>
Open the APP and then scan the movie Posters present in the Testing Folder.

<br/>
<br/>
<b>note: We don't own the movie trailers and the posters, just found it by simple google search.</b><br>
## Present Scnerio
<hr>
We have limited set of posters already stored in the system and using them only to represent the basic idea of what we are trying to develop.<br>
<hr>
## Future Aspects
Further, this concept can be implemented to the Augmented reality and computer graphics field, so that video clips can be used as a texture on any object.<br>
